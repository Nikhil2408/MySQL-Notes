# MySQL-Notes

This repository contains notes on MySQL which I have prepared while learning it. This repository will be updated whenever I find something new and useful related to MySQL. Learners can take full advantage of this repository. 

Let's start learning.......

<h2> What is a Database? </h2>

A database can be defined as a collection of data. It is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. The data stored in a database can be of anything either sales data, transaction data or even simple records.

If I talk about a physical database, a phonebook is an example of it. :sweat_smile:

<h2> Database Management System </h2>

The simplest definition of Database Management System is that it is a software which is used to manage(acesss, update) the database. DBMS provides an interface to perform various operations like database creation, storing data in it, updating data, creating a table in the database and a lot more.
